<!-- app.js -->

This file is where you define your API.
It should contain:

Creation of the Express app

Middlewares (like JSON parsing, CORS, logging)

All API routes (e.g., /api/health, later /api/auth, /api/staff)

Optional error handling

ðŸ‘‰ Think of app.js as the blueprint of your server â€” what it can do


<!-- index.js -->

This file is the startup script.
It should contain:

Import of the Express app (from app.js)

Connection to MongoDB (and any other startup tasks)

Starting the server with app.listen on the configured port

ðŸ‘‰ Think of index.js as the engine starter â€” it turns everything on and gets your API running.

<!-- In short: -->

app.js = define the server (routes, middlewares, error handling)

index.js = start the server (connect DB, open port, run app)
